# MSD_recommendation
There is a dataset of more than a million songs. Analysis was done and it can recommend songs based on user's listen history
The dataset itself was very hard to load in python, since I already loaded it up, I have added the entire csv file as 'Million_song.csv', yes it's a big file.
I have used libraries like- numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn.
Although it is predominantly a Machine Learning project, but 'recommenders'(the only ML application in this project) library was not compatible with my python version, so I got a little help from internet using that function. I also have attached it as 'Recommenders.py'
